                <p class="text-justify">Scicademy's goal was to create an open-access, open source, student research database for high school students so their research does not fade away into oblivion after a science fair.
                The value hypothesis was that high school students wanted to share their research online to benefit humanity.</p>

                    inexperience, I did not conduct any user/market research or customer interviews, unwisely leaving me in the dark.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I pushed the site heavily within my own high school and through online media
                sites such as Reddit and Hackernews. Through this, I were able to get 9,500 monthly page views,
                    200+ users, and 38 stars on <a href="https://bit.ly/2wGrhNL">Github</a>. I had around 20 papers
                submitted to the site.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">While I had some action on the website, most of it required extensive marketing.
                I did not provide much value at all to users, so people were mostly posting because I pushed them to
                not because they saw value in this. I could have easily found out that my value hypothesis (students
                want to put their research online to help the world) was false had I conducted user interviews or
                built an MVP.</p>

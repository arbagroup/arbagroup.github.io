                <p class="text-justify">I have a passion for validating ideas, so No More Bad Ideas was meant to be a service
                to help others validate their ideas. The value hypothesis was that people had ideas and wanted to know
                whether they were good enough to pursue.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">In a meta fashion, I wanted to validate this product idea itself. There were
                similar services out there already, but they were more about building someone's idea for them; however,
                their existence and seeming success supports the idea that consumers find value in services that can
                build upon their ideas. Nonetheless I still did customer interviews and found that many people have ideas
                but don't have a deep urge to pursue them. If they do, they usually are (possibly too) confident and attached
                to their idea that they don't see the need for a validation service.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I had spun up a quick landing page prior to customer interviews (an imprudent move).
                After customer interviews, I realized it would be best not to pursue this idea. Even though I had already
                    built the website, I did not fall prey to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a>
                and decided to abandon the idea because it would not provide value to people.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">This was a case where customer interviews proved extremely useful and clearly
                indicated whether something was a problem or not. Additionally, while a product may logically help users,
                it's important to consider the emotions behind how they act; customers want a product to make them feel
                good, and telling a customer that their idea isn't great doesn't make most people feel great.</p>

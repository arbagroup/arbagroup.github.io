                <p class="text-justify">Bike All Day was meant to be a niche site for bike enthusiasts looking for
                cool cheap accessories. The value hypothesis was that cyclists would want a convenient and easily accessible site where
                they could browse and purchase add-ons for their bike.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">Research was just done through a Google Survey sent out to 50 cyclists asking them
                about their experience purchasing bike accessories online. One prominent problem was price, so I sought
                to fix that. Surveys assume you know the right questions to ask, so not talking to customers in person
                was still a big mistake here.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I spent months learning WooCommerce to build this website. To keep prices low,
                I dropshipped (shipped directly from Chinese factories to purchaser), but I neglected to consider the
                quality concerns and didn't assess how much customers would be willing to sacrifice quality for price.
                This could have been preemptively addressed had I talked to customers or launched a site with just one
                    featured product to test whether customers would buy that (assuming the product doesn't have variations
                    that the user may want).
                I also advertised directly through Facebook ads, hoping for them to click the ad and make a purchase
                straightaway.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I had only $170 in sales throughout the lifetime of the website with ~$85 spent.
                People were not very likely to convert into a paying customer after merely clicking a Facebook ad.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I found that while my prices were low, consumers wouldn't immediately buy
                    something from a site they saw in an Facebook ad. I should have built trust by getting people to
                    like my page and then advertising to those. The half of my value hypothesis about wanting cheap
                products was right, but I failed to consider the trust that customers desired in shops. Simple user
                experience testing could have solved this.</p>

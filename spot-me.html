                <p class="text-justify">Spot Me was slated to be a platform where users could easily borrow very small
                amounts of money. The value hypothesis was that millennials would be willing to
                pay a small flat fee in order to have a small loan ($10-$200) sent directly to their Venmo.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I talked to 6 customers (not as many as I should have) and found that there
                definitely were times when they borrowed small amounts of money from a friend. I just needed to find out whether they
                would rather borrow money from a company (in case they feel embarrassed by asking their friends). I could
                have asked them about their feelings regarding borrowing from a company, but most people do not know
                what they want so their answer would not be very useful.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I decided to use a smoke screen MVP coupled with a simpler version of the app.
                    I had a landing page set up, posted fliers around NYC advertising the site, and observed the conversion
                    rate. For users who signed up and I believed were trustworthy, I emailed them to initiate the process
                    of receiving a micro loan. Since I were so new, there was a significant issue of trust; I could not
                concoct a way to honestly circumvent this issue, so that may have impacted results.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I had a conversion rate of 0.8% (Keep in mind this was from an ad that was randomly posted around NYC.)
                    Out of those who converted, I emailed four to begin the process of borrowing money. None of them
                    responded to the email or follow-up. This could have been because they signed up just out of curiosity initially.
                    Email is also not the most trustworthy method of communication when compared to phone.

                <p class="text-justify">Minimum viable products are usually viewed as scrappy (although for those who
                adhere strictly to the <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">scooter-then-care
                        MVP ideology</a> would argue that MVPs should never be scrappy). This becomes an issue when your
                product revolves around something in which trust is essential. I should have gone with an MVP where we
                could easily establish that trust, such as a booth at an event on my own college campuses. My MVP never
                met those trust needs, so I are not sure if people did not reply because of trust or lack of interest in
                the product. This idea still could have merit, but I researched more and did not want to deal with
                the legal struggles of this industry so I moved on.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The Product Intuition Newsletter (PIN) was created as a way for me (Aram) to personally
                hone my product intuition skills. The value hypothesis was that others out there wanted a digestible
                yet occasional way to sharpen their product intuition.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">LinkedIn has a mentoring service that connected Aram with many other product managers.
                Through these, I was able to interview eight product managers about their product intuition skills. I found
                    that many did not see product intuition as a skill that they were keen on developing; they were more
                    focused on other skills such as team building and user research. Two PMs did think product intuition
                    was an important skill, however, meaning this could be a niche product. Most said it was a nice idea,
                    but this should be disregarded since people don't know what they want and will always
                say something is a good idea to make you feel nice.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I spun up a simple early access landing page to see if people desired a way to
                sharpen their product intuition. I could have surveyed them, but actually entering their email is a much
                stronger indicator. But sometimes people just sign up because they're curious, so I emailed all the people
                who signed up asking them to rate this product intuition development problem on a scale from 1-5. The median
                response was a 2, so I saw that as a sign that this may not provide much value and would likely lead to many
                people unsubscribing after a week or two.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I saved hours of producing product intuition content for a crowd that would likely
                lose interest quickly and did not have a big enough problem.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I think the strategy of emailing landing page signups asking them to rate the
                problem is an effective method to determine if people are just curious or actually struggling with a problem.
                It's also important to realize that all products are not situated to help all people, even within a product
                category. For example, if I had launched this product, it may have been very helpful to a niche of product
                managers. So you can still provide significant value to a small amount of people in a niche, the question
                is whether it is worth your time to do that.</p>

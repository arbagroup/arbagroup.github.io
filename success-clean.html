                <p class="text-justify">Success Clean was a home cleaning business for Great Neck, New York. The value
                hypothesis was that Great Neck residents had an unmet need for a reliable high quality house cleaner.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Instead of talking to customers, I streamlined the process by scouring Yelp
                reviews of existing cleaning services nearby. I found that the number one problem was quality; homeowners
                in the area rarely complained about the price but never missed an opportunity to attack a company on its quality.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I found home cleaners and set up a quick online presence that allowed customers
                    to book online or through phone. I decided to initially invest in an automated online booking
                system since customers indicated this as a sign of quality in their reviews..</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text-justify">I initially struggled to get sales due to intense competition advertising in
                all conceivable market channels; I had neglected to consider the marginal value I would provide in
                relation to other competitors in the area. Once I pivoted to an area that had primarily 3 star or less
                Yelp reviews for home cleaning services, I ended the summer with 23 sales. I considered this a success
                and shut down the business to pursue larger opportunities in college.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">It is easy to find small things that other companies are not doing right; however,
                it's important to consider the switching costs. If you plan to launch a competitor, ensure that the marginal
                value provided is more than just patching a couple of issues that another company had; they must be
                significant enough for a customer to abandon their current platform to choose yours. This is why I had
                greater success when I switched to an area that had a greater unmet need (more low star reviews and thus
                    bigger problems/need).</p>
